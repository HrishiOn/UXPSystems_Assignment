Hi, I have created a simple Springboot project with REST, MVC, and thymeleaf. 
I have configuredH2 database, data, schema sql files to load the data. 

It is still a work in progress, but you can pull the project and run 'mvn clean install spring-boot:run'.
There no extra dependency you'd need to add to it.
